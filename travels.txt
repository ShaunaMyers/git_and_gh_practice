<Some of my most transformative vacation
experiences have involved backpacking alone
in Europe. My favorite American vacation
destination is this whimsical little town (
completely unexpected location): Eureka
Springs, Arkansas. It reminds me a little of
Europe and it's this little mecca for the
LGBTQ community of the South. It contains
artists, scientists, open-minded persons,
eccentrics, and has so much history and
awesome architecture. Oh! It also has like
50 fresh water springs. I love it.>
